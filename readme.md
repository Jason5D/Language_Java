This small project is to practice my knowledge of the Java language.

Conveniently called Language, it will give me information about different languages around the world.

I hope to practice classes, polymorphism and 2D arrays. Below are some additional steps I'd like to add to the project:

1. Build an array or ArrayList of several language objects and loop through them to call getInfo().
2. Add new methods that allow users to set a specific region, change the number of speakers, or modify the word order.
3. Create several more language family classes that pertain to languages youâ€™re interested in.
4. Map out the sign language families.
5. Add in further linguistic features (e.g., which genders are used, whether the language is tonal, etc.).
